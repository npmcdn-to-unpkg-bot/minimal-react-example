# Minimal React Example

No server, no build, just React on your browser.

# Demo

Start up an http server and navigate to index.html

With Node:
1. npm install http-server
2. node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
3. Open a browser to localhost:8080 

# Notes

As this is a basic React example, module loading is not present for simplicity. React and defined components are shared on the window Object.
